This exits the batch script and returns an error code:

```batch
exit /b 1
```

**Breaking it down:**

1. **`exit`** - Terminates/stops the batch script

2. **`/b`** - "Exit Batch only"
   - Exits **only the current batch script**, not the entire command prompt window
   - Without `/b`, it would close the entire Command Prompt window

3. **`1`** - The **exit code** (return value)
   - `0` = success (no errors)
   - `1` (or any non-zero) = failure/error

**Why use it?**

When a command fails, you want to:
1. Stop the script from continuing (prevent further errors)
2. Report that an error occurred (exit code 1)

**Example in your script:**
```batch
CALL "%USERPROFILE%\anaconda3\Scripts\activate.bat"
if errorlevel 1 (
    echo ERROR: Failed to initialize conda
    pause
    exit /b 1    ← Stop here if conda activation failed
)
```

**Comparison:**

```batch
exit /b 1     → Exits script with error, keeps Command Prompt open
exit /b 0     → Exits script successfully
exit 1        → Exits script AND closes the entire Command Prompt window
```

**Summary:** It stops the batch script with an error status, useful for preventing the script from continuing when something goes wrong, while keeping the console window open.
