This is a **comment** in a Windows batch file:

```batch
:: Initialize conda
```

**What it does:**
- **`::`** - Creates a comment in batch files
- **Nothing** - Comments are ignored when the script runs
- Used to document what the code does

**Batch file comments:**

There are two ways to write comments in `.bat` files:

1. **`::`** (double colon) - Most common
   ```batch
   :: This is a comment
   :: Initialize conda
   ```

2. **`REM`** (remark)
   ```batch
   REM This is also a comment
   REM Initialize conda
   ```

**Why use comments?**
- Explain what sections of code do
- Make scripts easier to understand
- Document your intentions

**In your case:**
This comment indicates that the following lines of code will initialize **conda** (a Python/data science package manager and environment system). It's just a label/note for anyone reading the script.
