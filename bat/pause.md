This pauses the script and waits for user input:

```batch
pause
```

**What it does:**
- **Stops** the script execution
- Displays: `Press any key to continue . . .`
- **Waits** for the user to press any key
- Then continues running the script

**Why use it?**

In your error handling block:
```batch
if errorlevel 1 (
    echo ERROR: Failed to initialize conda
    pause              ← Wait here so user can read the error
    exit /b 1
)
```

**Purpose:**
- Gives the user time to **read the error message**
- Without `pause`, the error would flash on screen and the window might close immediately
- User can see what went wrong before the script exits

**When to use `pause`:**
```batch
echo Script completed!
pause                    ← Let user see the completion message

echo ERROR: Something failed
pause                    ← Let user read the error

echo Debug info: %variable%
pause                    ← Let user see debug information
```

**Alternatives:**
```batch
timeout /t 5            → Wait 5 seconds automatically (no key press needed)
pause > nul             → Pause without showing "Press any key..." message
```

**Summary:** It's a way to make the script wait so users can read messages before continuing or exiting.
