This is an **error checking** statement in batch files:

```batch
if errorlevel 1 (
```

**What it does:**
Checks if the previous command **failed** (returned an error).

**Breaking it down:**

1. **`errorlevel`** - A special variable that holds the **exit code** of the last command
   - `0` = success (no error)
   - `1` or higher = failure/error

2. **`if errorlevel 1`** - Tests if errorlevel is **1 or greater**
   - True = the previous command failed
   - False = the previous command succeeded

3. **`(`** - Opens a code block that runs if the condition is true

**In your script:**
```batch
CALL "%USERPROFILE%\anaconda3\Scripts\activate.bat"
if errorlevel 1 (
    echo ERROR: Failed to initialize conda
    pause
    exit /b 1
)
```

**What happens:**
1. Try to activate conda
2. If it **fails** (errorlevel 1 or higher):
   - Print an error message
   - Pause (wait for user to press a key)
   - Exit the script with error code 1

**Modern alternative:**
You can also check specific error levels:
```batch
if %errorlevel% neq 0 (
    echo Command failed with error code: %errorlevel%
)
```

**Summary:** It's a safety check to catch errors and prevent the script from continuing when something goes wrong.
