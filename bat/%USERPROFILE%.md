This line runs the conda activation script:

```batch
CALL "%USERPROFILE%\anaconda3\Scripts\activate.bat"
```

**What it is:**
- **`CALL`** - Executes another batch file and returns control
- **`%USERPROFILE%`** - Environment variable that contains your user folder path (e.g., `C:\Users\qslia`)
- **`\anaconda3\Scripts\activate.bat`** - Path to the conda initialization script

**To print and see what it expands to:**

Add an `echo` command before it:

```batch
:: Initialize conda
echo Initializing conda...
echo DEBUG: %USERPROFILE%\anaconda3\Scripts\activate.bat
CALL "%USERPROFILE%\anaconda3\Scripts\activate.bat"
```

Or print just the variable:

```batch
echo User Profile: %USERPROFILE%
```

**What you'll see:**
```
User Profile: C:\Users\qslia
```

So the full path becomes:
```
C:\Users\qslia\anaconda3\Scripts\activate.bat
```

**Quick test:**
You can also check environment variables in PowerShell:
```powershell
echo $env:USERPROFILE
```

Or in Command Prompt:
```batch
echo %USERPROFILE%
```

This will show you exactly what path it's using!
