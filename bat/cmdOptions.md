This opens a new **interactive Command Prompt** and keeps it open:

```batch
cmd /k
```

**Breaking it down:**

1. **`cmd`** - Starts a new Command Prompt (command line interface)

2. **`/k`** - "Keep" or "Carry on"
   - Keeps the Command Prompt window **open** after running commands
   - The window stays interactive so you can type commands

**Comparison:**

```batch
cmd /k          → Opens Command Prompt and KEEPS it open (interactive)
cmd /c          → Opens Command Prompt, runs command, then CLOSES
cmd             → Just opens a new Command Prompt
```

**Why use it in your script?**

Looking at your script context:
```batch
echo Starting interactive session...
echo Type 'exit' to close this window when you're done.
cmd /k
```

**Purpose:**
- Your batch file sets up the conda environment and navigates to Desktop
- Then it opens an **interactive session** where you can type commands
- You now have a Command Prompt with:
  - Conda initialized ✓
  - `detectron2` environment activated ✓
  - Working directory at `C:\Users\qslia\Desktop\` ✓
  - Ready for you to type commands!

**Use case:**
You can now manually run Python scripts, conda commands, or any other commands in the prepared environment without having to set it up each time.

**Summary:** It's like saying "I've set everything up, now give the user an interactive terminal to work in."
