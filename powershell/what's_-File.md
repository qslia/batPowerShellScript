This line retrieves all files from the current directory and sorts them by name:

```powershell
$files = Get-ChildItem -Path . -File | Sort-Object Name
```

**Breaking it down:**

1. **`Get-ChildItem`** - PowerShell cmdlet (command) that lists files and folders
   - Similar to `ls` in Linux or `dir` in Windows Command Prompt

2. **`-Path .`** - Specifies the location to search
   - `.` means the **current directory**

3. **`-File`** - Filter to get **only files** (excludes folders/directories)

4. **`|`** - The **pipe operator** 
   - Sends the output from the left command to the right command

5. **`Sort-Object Name`** - Sorts the files alphabetically by their Name property

6. **`$files =`** - Stores all the results in a variable called `$files`

**What it does:**
Gets all files in the current directory, sorts them alphabetically (1.txt, 2.jpg, file.pdf, etc.), and stores them in the `$files` variable so you can work with them later in your script.

**Example:**
If your directory has: `zebra.txt`, `apple.doc`, `banana.jpg`

After this line runs, `$files` will contain them in order:
- `apple.doc`
- `banana.jpg`
- `zebra.txt`
