This line displays a summary message showing **how many files were successfully renamed**:

```powershell
Write-Host "Total files renamed: $($counter - 1)" -ForegroundColor Red
```

**Breaking it down:**
- **`Write-Host`** - Outputs text to the console
- **`"Total files renamed: "`** - Static text
- **`$($counter - 1)`** - A PowerShell **subexpression** that:
  - Takes the value of the `$counter` variable
  - Subtracts 1 from it
  - Displays the result
- **`-ForegroundColor Red`** - Displays the text in red color

**Why `$counter - 1`?**
Looking at your `37.ps1` script, `$counter` starts at 1 and increments *after* each successful rename. So if 5 files were renamed, `$counter` would be 6 at the end. Subtracting 1 gives the actual count of renamed files (5).

**Example output:**
```
Total files renamed: 5
```

**Note:** This line uses red color, which is typically used for errors or warnings. You might want to change it to Cyan (like in `37.ps1` line 36) or Green for a success metric:
```powershell
Write-Host "Total files renamed: $($counter - 1)" -ForegroundColor Cyan
```
