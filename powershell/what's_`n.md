This line is a **success message** displayed at the end of a file renaming script:

```powershell
Write-Host "`nRenaming completed!" -ForegroundColor Green
```

**What it does:**
- **`Write-Host`** - Outputs text to the console
- **`` `n``** - Adds a blank line before the message (newline character)
- **`"Renaming completed!"`** - The success message text
- **`-ForegroundColor Green`** - Displays the text in green color (indicating success)

**In context of your script:**
Your `37.ps1` script is a **batch file renamer** that:
1. Gets all files in the current directory
2. Asks for confirmation 
3. Renames them sequentially (1.txt, 2.pdf, 3.jpg, etc.)
4. This line (35) prints a final success message after all files have been processed

So when the script finishes running, you'll see:
```
[blank line]
Renaming completed!
Total files renamed: 5
```

The green color and blank line above make the completion message stand out visually from the previous output.
